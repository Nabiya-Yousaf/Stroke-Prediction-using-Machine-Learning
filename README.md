# 🧠 Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning  

This repository contains a project from my MSc Data Science program (University of Essex, 2025), focusing on **stroke risk prediction using machine learning models**.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Strokes are one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. This project applies **AI and ML techniques** to predict stroke occurrence based on healthcare and lifestyle factors.  

Dataset: [Healthcare Stroke Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, imputation, feature scaling).  
- Train and compare **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.  
- Evaluate models based on accuracy and generalization.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **Code/** → Jupyter notebooks and scripts for analysis and models.  
- **Data/** → Dataset (or link to Kaggle).  
- **Results/** → Model evaluation metrics and visualizations.  
- **Docs/** → Report, slides, and documentation.
